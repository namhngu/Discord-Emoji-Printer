# Discord-Emoji-Printer
Discord Bot that prints out pictures as custom emojis through the command ::printPic 
Similar to "pixelization" filters, the bot breaks down the big picture into squares in which the average RGB value is calculated. From this, the bot then correlates it with the emoji with the most similar "average RGB value". 

To use the bot, the bot will need the ability to read text/files and print out text/emojis in your server. Also, within the code, you will need to input your specific token for your bot and the guild ID the bot is in.
